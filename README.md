# CTB Tracing Superior Colliculus
This script is meant to be a replacement for an Image Pro macro to quantify in tact CTB transport to the superior colliculus. The Image Pro macro is no longer maintained and the license for Image Pro is $5k.
Eventually, this is meant to become a more automated repository. Currently, significant manual input is needed in ImageJ tracing ROIs. 

1. Trace ROI of superficial layers of SC and save
2. Determine background level to substract
3. Input background levels for each slice into excel sheet
4. Run program to get SC transport values output to an excel sheet and heatmap images.
